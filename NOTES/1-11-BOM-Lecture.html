<h1>BOM and DOM</h1>

<h3>Key Terms</h3>
<h4>Browser Object Model (BOM)</h4>
<p>The API of the browser that allows JavaScript to communicate with the browser.[8]</p>
<h4>Document Object Model (DOM)</h4>
<p>The data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.[9]</p>
<h4>Node</h4>
<p>An HTML element. The "DOM" is a tree structure that represents the HTML of the website, and every HTML element is a "node". More specifically, "Node" is an interface that is implemented by multiple objects.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Document Object Model (DOM) defines a standard for accessing documents.[2]</li>
    <li>The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to "talk to" the browser.[3]</li>
    <li>In the HTML DOM, the Element object represents an HTML element, like P, DIV, A, TABLE, or any other HTML
        element.[4]</li>
    <li>Parent-child relationships within the DOM can be used to target document elements. It is possible to move
        (traverse) from parent to child (downwards), from child to parent (upwards), and from sibling to sibling
        (sideways).[5]</li>
    <li>HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.[6]</li>
    <li>DOM allows JavaScript to access several pieces of information about a browser (with some limits for security) including: history, screen size, location, and cookies. [7]</li>
