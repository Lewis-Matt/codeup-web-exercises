<!--The method attribute of a form element refers to the HTTP method that should be used to transmit the form data.
If no method is specified, by default, the GET method will be used. While other HTTP methods exist, the html
specification limits us to using GET and POST in forms.

HTTP GETs are used to request information, without making any changes to data on the server. When a form's method is set to GET,
any of the data that the form sends will be appended to the url in the form of a query string.

HTTP POSTs are used to make a change to existing data on the server. When a form's method is set to POST, any of the data
that the form sends will not be added to the url, but will instead be embedded in the body of the HTTP request as key-value pairs.
If you have ever been asked a question like, "Are you sure you want to re-submit this form?", then you were probably refreshing a page after submitting an HTTP POST.

The action attribute of an HTML form refers to the location that the form data should be sent. If no action is specified,
by default, the action will be set to send data back to the current url.
A query string is composed of key-value pairs. It begins with a question mark (?). Following the question mark, is the first key-value pair.
Key-value pairs are structured as key=value. Key-value pairs after the first will be separated by ampersands (&).
EX:
?key1=value1&key2=value2&key3=value3
Whenever you use the GET method in an HTML form, the form inputs will be appended to the url in the format shown above.
If you are using a POST method in an HTML form, the inputs will be sent as a query string (this time without the preceding question mark) in the body of the HTTP request-->

<!--The label element is used to label form inputs. Label elements should have a for attribute that matches up with the id attribute of the
element that is being labeled. When a form input is properly labeled, clicking on the label will focus that input element.
This is particularly useful for checkboxes and radio buttons, and it is a common practice to wrap checkbox and radio inputs with a label-->
