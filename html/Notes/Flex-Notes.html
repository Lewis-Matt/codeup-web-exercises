<!--Flexbox provides a convenient way to arrange the layout of elements (flex items) inside a parent container (the
"flexible box" or flex container). While a full page layout can be created using multiple flexbox containers and
items, flexbox is optimized for a one dimensional layout.-->

<!--Dimensions define the primary demarcation between Flexbox and CSS Grid. Flexbox was designed specifically for
one-dimensional layouts, while CSS Grid is engineered to enable two-dimensional layouts. Therefore, CSS Grid can
easily render rows and columns simultaneously.-->

<!--flexbox is optimized to control alignment of items in a row or column layout. In a flex-direction: row; layout
(the default), the horizontal axis is referred to as the "main axis" and the vertical axis is referred to as the
"cross axis," When the flex container is set to a column layout, the main and cross axes are inverted. -->
