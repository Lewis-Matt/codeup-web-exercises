<h1>Ajax</h1>
<p>
    Ajax is a group of interrelated Web development techniques used on the client-side to create asynchronous web
    applications. With Ajax, web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the
    background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. Data can be retrieved using the
    XMLHttpRequest object. Despite the name, the use of XML is not required (JSON is often used in the AJAJ variant),
    and the requests do not need to be asynchronous.

<h2>XML</h2>
<ul>
    <li>XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language</li>
    <li>XML is a markup language much like HTML</li>
    <li>XML was designed to store and transport data</li>
    <li>XML was designed to be self-descriptive</li>
    <li>XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is</li>
    <li>HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks</li>
    <li>XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are</li>
    <li>XML documents are formed as element trees.</li>
    <li>An XML tree starts at a root element and branches from the root to child elements.</li>
    <li>All elements can have sub elements (child elements):</li>
    <li>Thousands of XML formats exist, in many different industries, to describe day-to-day data transactions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example of XML format of a XMLNews document</h3>
<code>
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <nitf>
        <head>
            <title>Colombia Earthquake</title>
        </head>
        <body>
        <headline>
            <hl1>143 Dead in Colombia Earthquake</hl1>
        </headline>
        <byline>
            <bytag>By Jared Kotler, Associated Press Writer</bytag>
        </byline>
        <dateline>
            <location>Bogota, Colombia</location>

<h2>JavaScript Object Notation - JSON</h2>
<p>
    JSON is a data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write. It is widely used in cloud based
    services and web application programming interfaces (APIs). Object properties in JSON must be double-quoted strings,
    and properties are separated by a commas.
</p>
<code>
    {<br>
    "name1": "value1",<br>
    "name2": "value2"<br>
    }
</code>
The value of a property can be one of the following:
<ul>
    <li>A quoted string</li>
    <li>A number</li>
    <li>An object</li>
    <li>An array</li>
    <li>true or false</li>
    <li>null</li>
</ul>
<p>In the real-world you will most likely not edit these files directly; rather, JSON would most likely be automatically
    generated, or sent and received by a web server.</p>
