<h1>jQuery Overview</h1>
<p>
    We will be using the jQuery object to find and create HTML elements from the DOM.<br>
    Definition:
    Return a collection of matched elements either found in the DOM based on passed argument(s) or created by passing an
    HTML string.
    Shorthand:
    In jQuery, we commonly use the dollar sign $, an alias of jQuery to reference the jQuery object.
</p>
<p>
    JavaScript provides the ability to natively determine if the window has finished loading using the window.onload
    event handler.<br>
    <code>
        window.onload = function() {<br>
        alert( 'The page has finished loading!' );<br>
        }<br>
    </code>
    While this is a good way to make sure the page is fully loaded and ready for DOM manipulation, it waits until all
    images have finished downloading. We usually do not need the image files to be fully downloaded to begin
    manipulating DOM objects.
</p>
<p>
    We can use jQuery to select the document object and add an event listener called ready. This event listener will
    fire as soon as the DOM is ready to be manipulated, before all the images have completed downloading.

    To use the document ready event listener, we can select the document and chain the ready() method:<br>

    <code>$(document).ready();</code>
</p>
<p>
    Passing an anonymous function in ready() will execute our code when the document is ready for JavaScript
    manipulation:<br>
    <code>
        $(document).ready(function() {<br>
        alert( 'The DOM has finished loading!' );<br>
        });<br>
    </code>
</p>
<p>
    While using document ready is very common, if we put our JavaScript at the bottom of our document, it will already
    be loaded by the time the JavaScript is loaded. Using document ready will ensure the DOM is loaded before
    running.
</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
    All JavaScript code snippets should be assumed to be inside a larger file with "use strict"; at the top and inside a
    $(document).ready function.<br>
    my-custom-javascript.js <br>
    <code>
        "use strict";<br>
        $(document).ready(function() {<br>
        // INSERT JAVASCRIPT CODE SAMPLE HERE <br>
        });
    </code>
</p>
<h2>jQuery Selectors</h2>
<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Selector</th>
        <th class="center">Syntax</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>ID Selector</td>
        <td class="center"><code>#id</code></td>
        <td>Selects a single element with the given id attribute.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Class Selector</td>
        <td class="center"><code>.class</code></td>
        <td>Selects all elements with the given class.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Element Selector</td>
        <td class="center"><code>element</code></td>
        <td>Selects all elements with the given tag name.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Multiple Selector</td>
        <td class="center"><code>selector1[, selector2[, ...]]</code></td>
        <td>Selects the combined results of all the specified selectors.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>All Selector</td>
        <td class="center"><code>*</code></td>
        <td>Selects all elements.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>
    The general syntax for manipulating elements with jQuery selectors is:
</p>
<code>$('selector')</code>
<p>There are several important things to note here:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the selector is written inside a string</li>
    <li>the string is inside of $(), which is just calling a function named $</li>
    <li>this will return us a jQuery object</li>
</ul>
<p>
    $ is a valid identifier in javascript, which means we can name our functions or variables $ (although you probably
    shouldn't). $ is a commonly used shorthand for jQuery, and using either one will accomplish the same thing. So these
    two
    code blocks are functionally identical:
    <code>
        <br> $('selector')

        <br> jQuery('selector')</code>
</p>
<p>
    All selector expressions return us a jQuery object, which is just an object that represents zero or more HTML
    elements, with all the methods of jQuery attached to it.
    For now, we need to know the basics of two methods:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>.html: returns the HTML contents of selected element or the first element in a collection. Similar to the
        innerHTML property we previously covered.
    </li>
    <li>.css: allows us to change CSS properties for a given element or elements. Similar to the style property
        previously discussed.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Basic syntax is: $(selector).action()
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A $ sign to define/access jQuery</li>
    <li>A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements</li>
    <li>A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)</li>
</ul>

<h3>jQuery version notes</h3>
<p>We are using 2.2.4 release for this course.
    Each version has two different release types: compressed (production) and uncompressed (development).
    We will be using the uncompressed copies for our applications and will switch them out for the compressed versions
    when we launch our product on a production server.</p>
