"use strict";
console.log("Hello from external JavaScript");


// Use the alert function to show a message that says 'Welcome to my Website!'.
alert('Welcome to my website');
// Use a prompt to ask for the user's favorite color. Use the user's response to alert a message that says that the color
// entered is your favorite color too.
// For example, if the user enters "blue", your code should alert a message that says:
// "Great, blue is my favorite color too!"
let favoriteColor = prompt('What is your favorite color?');
alert(`${favoriteColor} is my favorite color too!`);


// Complete exercise 3 from the previous lesson, but write your code in the external.js file instead of in the console.
// When the exercise asks you to use a number, instead use a prompt to ask the user for that number.
// Use an alert to show the results of each problem.

// Which exercise is this referring to? The previous lesson, ex 3, never asks for an number input
